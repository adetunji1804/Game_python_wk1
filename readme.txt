Project: Dice roll game
    Aim: To refresh my python skills by using loop, function, class, object, list, dictionary list, exception
         and modules to create a simple interactive dice roll game.
Operation: The program prompt for the number of players [range from 2 or more]
           It then prompt for the name of players. It instruct players to take turn
           rolling the dice by prompting for number of times to help automatically roll it.
           [A high input number of dice roll, does not guaranty a high total number in return].
           It display the result in respective to each player, the player with highest number
           is the winner.

Limitation: The max function to fetch the highest dice number from the list was not consistent fetching the
            highest number.
